Version 1 can be found [here](https://github.com/brianmichel/solarized/tree/master/apple-xcode4-solarized)

My vision of Solarized theme for xCode 5+. Swapped some colors for better code readability. Original Solarized theme based on xCode default highlighting which doesn't distinguish colors for Class Name, Constant, Type Name etc. This version uses same colors as original theme (only custom color is for cursor in Light Theme for better visibility). You can compare code syntax highlight on screenshots below and choose better theme for yourself.
